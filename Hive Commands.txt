Q1.1 - Find the total number of tickets for the year.
Command – 
select count(*) from parkingviolations where  year(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issuedate,'MM/dd/yyyy'),'yyy-MM-dd'))=2017;
Answer – There are 5,431,903 parking violations in the year 2017

Q1.2 - Find out the total number of states to which the cars with tickets belong.
Command - select count(distinct(RegistrationState)) from parkingviolations where issuedate like '%2017' and RegistrationState rlike '^([A-Z])';
Answer – Cars belong to 64 States with ticket

Q1.2 Optional Question – List of states with tickets
Command - select distinct(RegistrationState) from parkingviolations where issuedate like '%2017' and RegistrationState rlike '^([A-Z])’;
Answer – Cars belong to 64 States with ticket

Q1.3 – Find out the number of such tickets which have no addresses.
Command - select count(*) from parkingviolations where StreetCode1 is null or StreetCode2 is null or StreetCode1 is null; 
Answer – 49 tickets have  no addresses (either of StreetCode1, 2 and 3 is null)

Q2.1 – Find out the frequency of parking violations across different times of the day
Commands – 
select StreetCode1, StreetCode2, StreetCode3 from parkingviolations where StreetCode1 is null or StreetCode2 is null or StreetCode1 is null;
select count(*) from parkingviolations where StreetCode1 is null or StreetCode2 is null or StreetCode1 is null;
Answer – 9 AM and 1 PM are the hours with maximum parking violations. 

Q2.2 – Divide 24 hours into six equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations.
Command – 
select * from (
